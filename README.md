# 🚀 @tdev/toolkit

**A modular Full Stack development toolkit built and maintained by [Thalys Dev](https://github.com/thalys93)**  
Designed to boost productivity, enforce architecture consistency, and accelerate development across multiple projects.

---

## 🧠 Why this toolkit?

In modern development, reusability and scalability are king. `@tdev/toolkit` is crafted to provide plug-and-play modules that abstract essential services and boilerplate logic — so you can focus on what really matters: building great products.

---

## 🧩 Toolkit Modules

Each module is standalone, configurable, and integration-ready:

- 🔒 **Auth Module**  ❌
  Seamless user authentication with strategies like JWT, OAuth, and more.

- 💳 **Payment Module** 🧱 (wip)
  Abstracts payment gateway logic (e.g. Mercado Pago, Stripe) with support for subscriptions and transactions.

- 📧 **Email Module** ✅
  Plug-and-play transactional emails with provider flexibility (SMTP, SendGrid, etc).

- 🔔 **Notifications Module**  ❌
  Real-time and scheduled notifications via multiple channels (email, push, in-app).

- 📁 **Files Module**  ❌
  File uploads, storage, and media handling with services like Cloudinary and S3.

- 👤 **Users Module**  ❌
  Core user management, profiles, roles, and permissions.

> ✨ New modules will be added progressively — ideas like Logging, Analytics, and External Integrations are already brewing.

## 🔧 Core System Check
